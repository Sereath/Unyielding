    Gillymoth Diagnostic section:

==========================================================================


   Follow these steps if:

  -changing your version of Ruins
  -Adding new biomes into an existing instance of the game where Ruins is already installed

---

   Delete the Ruins.txt file and restart Minecraft to regenerate this file.


   The Ruins.txt file contains pointers to all the active biomes,
   This file is generated only if it's missing.

=================

  -If few or no structures are spawning in your world

---

   in 1.12 the biomes were renamed, along with the folders.

   If you have two sets of biome folders and can't tell which ones are correct,
   then move all the biome folders into a temp folder and let Ruins regenerate them,
   and after restarting minecraft, open the biome folders and move the templates back in.

  -there will only be two sets of folders if you have installed two distinct
   and specific versions of Ruins in the same instance, relating to version 1.12


<<<<<  The filepath for all the biome folders:  >>>>>

  in 1.11 or earlier:   mods/resources/ruins

  in 1.12 or later:     config/ruins_config

=====================================================

Use these diagnostic tests when first installing Ruins

------------------


    When installing Ruins mod to confirm proper installation:

    type "/testruin tester" in the chat, it will do one of 4 things:

    -unknown command <-- the code for ruins is not installed in game
    -do not have permission <-- retest in creative mode, set in LAN or use creative test world
    -filepath does not exist <-- the folder structure needs to be in place (or just missing the test file)
    -a pile of blocks spawns around you <-- success!



   Another feature of Ruins can be used to instantly see if Ruins is installed:

   If you hold a stick in your hand and break a block,
   the chat will show the internal blockname and damage value (meta)
